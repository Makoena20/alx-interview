You are required to use request module for HTTP requests.
No usage of var, only let and const.
Learning Objectives
Interact with RESTful APIs.
Understand and make HTTP requests in Node.js.
Handle and process asynchronous code with callbacks, promises, and async/await.
Parse and manipulate JSON data.
Utilize command-line arguments to retrieve specific data.
