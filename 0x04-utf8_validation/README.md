0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Description
This project involves writing a Python method that determines if a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The dataset is represented as a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to a byte (8 least significant bits). The method must validate whether the sequence of bytes forms valid UTF-8 encoded characters.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of:

Bitwise operations in Python.
The UTF-8 encoding scheme.
Data representation at the byte level.
List manipulation in Python.
Boolean logic in Python.
Requirements
Python version: 3.4.3
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x).
All files should be executable.
Your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
